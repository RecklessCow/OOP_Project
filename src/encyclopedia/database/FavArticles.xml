            The Plague (French: La Peste) is a novel by Albert Camus. Published in 1947, it tells the
            story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran.
            The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel
            presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view.[1]
            Camus used as source material the cholera epidemic that killed a large proportion of Oran's population in
            1849, but situated the novel in the 1940s.[2] Oran and its surroundings were struck by disease several
            times before Camus published his novel. According to an academic study, Oran was decimated by the bubonic
            plague in 1556 and 1678, but all later outbreaks (in 1921: 185 cases; 1931: 76 cases; and 1944: 95 cases)
            were very far from the scale of the epidemic described
